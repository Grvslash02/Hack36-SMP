# Introduction

We've added a 'V' to our SMP program, transforming it into the STUDENT VIRTUAL MENTORSHIP PORTAL and incorporating a technological enhancement to the existing program. Through this portal, mentees can connect with their mentors online using video chat and group chat, and access official resources published on the SMP website. Mentors can create groups of mentees, hold online group meetings, and provide them with necessary resources, while also addressing doubts both individually and collectively.

Frequently, seniors and juniors find it challenging to schedule offline meetings. Our solution addresses this issue by allowing mentors and group members to share their available times, thus fostering better relationships and more effective mentoring sessions. Additionally, mentors can view the profiles of users and update data such as attendance at meetings and other relevant metrics.
